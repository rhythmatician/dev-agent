"""Dev Agent - AutoGen-based multi-agent system for automated test fixing.

This is the main entry point for the dev-agent CLI tool.
The tool implements a multi-agent system using AutoGen that:
1. Runs the target project's tests
2. Generates minimal unified-diff patches via a local LLM
3. Iterates until the tests pass
4. Commits/pushes fixes and optionally opens a PR

Usage:
    dev-agent [options] <project-path>

For full documentation, see: docs/PROJECT-OUTLINE.md
