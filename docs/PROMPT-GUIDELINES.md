# üìù PROMPT-GUIDELINES.md

These guidelines define **canonical prompt templates** and mandatory response
formats for each AutoGen role.
All prompts are plain-text with JSON placeholders; all responses **must** follow
the formats below so the orchestrator can parse them deterministically.

---

## 1. Placeholders

| Placeholder      | Injected Value                                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `{failure_json}` | JSON blob with `test_name`, `file_path`, `error`, `code_snippet` |
| `{diff_context}` | Code excerpt (¬± N lines) around the failing lines  |
| `{repo_stats}`   | Optional repo metrics (LOC, coverage %, etc.)      |

---

## 2. DevAgent Prompt Template

```text
You are DevAgent, an autonomous coder.

## Context
{failure_json}

### Task
1. Produce a **unified diff** that fixes **only** the failing test above.
2. Do **not** modify unrelated files or style.
3. Return **nothing else** except the diff.

### Format
```diff
--- a/<file>
+++ b/<file>
@@
<code changes>
````

If no patch is needed, reply exactly: **NO\_PATCH\_NEEDED**

````

### Response Rules

* The first non-empty line **must** be `--- a/‚Ä¶`.
* Enclose the diff inside <code>```diff</code> fences.
* Nothing‚Äîno explanation, no code fences before/after, no stray lines‚Äîmay appear
  outside the diff block.
* If multiple files change, concatenate hunks in a single block.

---

## 3. Supervisor Prompt Template

```text
You are Supervisor, responsible for high-level code quality.

## Patch Under Review
{diff_block}

## Phase Requirements
{phase_requirements}

### Task
1. Critically review the patch against the requirements.
2. Reply with **APPROVED** if the patch fully meets them.
3. Otherwise, list concrete revision requests.

### Format
```yaml
approved: true | false
comments:
  - "<actionable comment 1>"
  - "<actionable comment 2>"
````

````

### Response Rules

* `approved` **must** be a boolean.
* Provide at least one comment when `approved: false`.
* No extra keys allowed.

---

## 4. ShellTool Prompt Template

```text
Execute the following command in the workspace:

{command}
````

### Response

```json
{
  "exit_code": <int>,
  "stdout": "<captured stdout>",
  "stderr": "<captured stderr>"
}
```

---

## 5. GitTool Prompt Template

```text
Action: {git_action}
Arguments: {arguments_json}
```

### Supported Actions

| Action          | Description                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `create_branch` | Checkout new branch                 |
| `apply_patch`   | `git apply --index` the diff string |
| `commit`        | Commit staged changes               |
| `push`          | Push current HEAD                   |
| `open_pr`       | Create pull-request via `gh` CLI    |

### Response

```json
{
  "status": "success" | "error",
  "message": "<human-readable summary>"
}
```

---

## 6. General Style Rules

1. **Deterministic Output** ‚Äî no random phrasing; stick to templates.
2. **Patch Minimalism** ‚Äî change only what the test failure demands.
3. **Idempotence** ‚Äî re-applying the same diff must have no effect.
4. **Encoding** ‚Äî UTF-8 only; no BOM; preserve original line endings.
5. **Language** ‚Äî default to the language found in the existing file.

*These guidelines are authoritative.
Any prompt or response that violates them is rejected by the orchestrator.*
