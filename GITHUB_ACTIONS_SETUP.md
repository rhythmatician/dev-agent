## Usage After Merge & Release

Once the PR is merged and tagged, users can add this to their workflows:

```yaml
uses: rhythmatician/dev-agent@v0.1.1
with:
  test-command: "pytest --maxfail=1"
  max-iterations: "5"
  auto-pr: "true"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Review and merge the PR**
2. **Create and push the v0.1.1 tag:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag v0.1.1
   git push origin v0.1.1
   ```
3. **Publish to GitHub Marketplace:**
   - Go to repo â†’ Actions â†’ Manage â†’ "Publish this action"
   - Fill in marketplace details

## Repository Rules Note

The repository has protection rules requiring:
- Changes through pull requests
- Status checks to pass

This is why we created a feature branch and PR instead of pushing directly to main.

All tests are passing: âœ… 61 passed, 1 xfailed, 3 warnings
